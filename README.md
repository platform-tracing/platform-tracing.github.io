Distributed tracing has become an integral part of effective monitoring of modern distributed applications. The OpenTracing standard makes it possible to instrument applications for distributed tracing with minimal effort.

This organization is a place holder for our efforts related to adding of platform level metrics to application tracing. More specifically how to integrate Linux perf events to complement application tracing.
Linux perf events can compliment application side tracing in finding bottlenecks and identifying platform resources which were busy for a specific application transaction.
