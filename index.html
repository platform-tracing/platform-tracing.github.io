<p>Distributed tracing has become an integral part of effective monitoring of modern distributed applications. The OpenTracing standard makes it possible to instrument applications for distributed tracing with minimal effort.</p>
<p>This organization is a place holder for our efforts related to adding of platform level metrics to application tracing. More specifically how to integrate Linux perf events to complement application tracing.</p>
<p>Linux perf events can compliment application side tracing in finding bottlenecks and identifying platform resources which were busy for a specific application transaction.</p>
